# ES-screen-changer-script
This is a script for change EmulationStation logo

I created a small script to make it easier to change the ES EmulationStation logo for R36s without having to use a Linux computer.

Thanks to phafael_ for the custom screen, Upbeat-Serve-6096 for the Windows logo, and OmeuPai for the access path and for those who were forgotten.

It’s very simple: just place the ES screen changer folder and the ES screen changer.sh script in tools.

You can create your own SVG logo without renaming it to “splash”—as long as it has the .svg extension, the script will take care of the rest.
