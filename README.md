# ES-screen-changer-script
This is a script for change EmulationStation logo

I created a small script to make it easier to change the ES EmulationStation logo for R36s without having to use a Linux computer.

Thanks to phafael_ for the custom screen, Upbeat-Serve-6096 for the Windows logo, and OmeuPai for the access path and for those who were forgotten.

It’s very simple: just place the ES-screen-changer folder and the ES-screen-changer.sh script in /roms/tools.
After that, launch the script, go to option/tools and clic on ES-screen-changer.sh, select your svg. 


You can create your own SVG logo without renaming it to “splash”—as long as it has the .svg extension,You just need to add it in /roms/tools/ES-screen-changer folder, go to to option/tools and clic on ES-screen-changer.sh, select your svg and the script will take care of the rest
